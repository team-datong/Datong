PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The Da-tong Society of China Studies at Berkeley is a cultural and academic organization. They want to add functionalities to their current website to make it more useful to their members.
The Society aims to provide a communication and research platform for students who are interested in both historical and social issues of China and East Asia.
A well-built website will help our members integrate resources, outreach to the campus student body who is interested in participating in China Studies centered events(seminars, film nights, and reading sessions), and ultimately help them have a better understanding of culture, politics, and history of China.
